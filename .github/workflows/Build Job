# .github/workflows/demo-workflow.yml

# Name of the workflow as it appears in the Actions tab
name: GitHub Actions Demo

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    # Note: GitHub automatically skips builds if commit message contains [skip ci]

  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events but only for the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Note: The original request mentioned path filters, but the testing steps
  # involve modifying README.md to trigger the workflow. Therefore, path filters
  # that exclude README.md are omitted here to align with the testing procedure.
  # If you want to exclude README.md changes, uncomment the following:
  # paths-ignore:
  #   - 'README.md'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "Build"
  Build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    # 'ubuntu-latest' refers to the latest stable Ubuntu image provided by GitHub
    # Check documentation for specifics: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Specifies the version of the checkout action

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Output event name
        run: echo "Workflow triggered by event: ${{ github.event_name }}"

      # Runs another command
      # github.ref is the branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow run.
      # For pull requests, this is refs/pull/<pr_number>/merge
      # For pushes, this is refs/heads/<branch_name> or refs/tags/<tag_name>
      - name: Output branch name
        run: echo "Current repository reference: ${{ github.ref }}"

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          echo "Listing files in the repository root:"
